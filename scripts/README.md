## Scripts Overview

This folder contains bash scripts that were used throughout this project. It begins with downloading the genomes in step 1. 

1- download_genomes.sh contains the script created by Dr. Brooks (UVU Professor) and modified by Chatgpt for mac users to download the salmonella genomes from NCBI into the assembilies folder, which was further trimmed down from assembiles/ncbi_dataset/data into genomes_raw with the assistance of accession_files/cleaned_accession.txt to give 13 genomes that will be used for this project. 

2- run_busco.sh contains the script used to organize raw data for assessment summary (parse_busco_summaries.sh) found in busco_results.
