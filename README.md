# Genome Analysis Workflow
Contains a microbial genome analysis workflow using the raw data sequence generated by NCBI. This project is a step by step bioinformatic guide for quality control when comparing genomones and feature detection.

# Overview

The goal is to process and analyze raw bacterial for Salmonella Serovars seqencing data to produce assemble, annotated genomes, and interpreting their biological features.

# Workflow

Raw sequencing data from NCBI analyzed using the following steps:

1. Quality Control
- BUSCO 
- 
  
2. Genome Assembly
- Assemble sequencing reads into draft genomes.
- Examine assembly quality and completeness.
  
3. Genome Annotataion
- Examine genes and genomic features.
- Assign putative functional annotations.

4. Comparative Genomics
- Compare genomics of all samples.
- Identify shared and unique genomic regions.
  
5. Feature Detection
- Detect interest of genomic features.
- Examples may include metabolic pathways.
