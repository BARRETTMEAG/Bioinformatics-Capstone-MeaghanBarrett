# Assembly Evaluation Overview:

- Contains metrics that quantify assembly quality ("3 C's"):
    - assembly_stat.tsv: table with contiguity (N50, total length, number of contigs) and metric completeness.

- The difference between BUSCO_summary.tsv and assembly_stats.tsv:
    - BUSCO_summary contains only BUSCO scores (%)
    - assembly_stats contains BUSCO scores, N50, total length, and number of contigs
